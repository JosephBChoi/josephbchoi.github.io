I am a Ph. D. candidate an [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu). I have Computer Science and Mathematics background from undergraduate studies. My research interest lies in using generative AI for lower-dimensional representation of data to make the downstream tasks "easier". Along with generative AI, I am also interested in introducing physics into neural networks.

My current focus lies in using Artificial Intelligence for designing materials for target performance to satisfy the purpose of diverse applications (i.e., maximal performance for propellatns, control direction of explosion for safety concers in mining, etc.).  I am highly motivated and excited about the potential of using AI in materials design for targeted property, where it has conventionally relied on Edisonian approach led by domain expert's intution and knowledge due to the enormously large design space and highly expensive computation cost to validate candidate design. 

I am currently investigating the patterns of sub-optimum designs of the energetic materials in the latent design space learned by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which allows us to connect the dots from the past theoretical/experimental literatures and further expand our knowledge in the performance of the energetic materials with respect to the morphometry of microstructural designs.
